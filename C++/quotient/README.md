# Quotient and Remainder Calculator

A simple C++ console application that performs integer division and displays the quotient and remainder, along with verification of the division operation.

## Overview

This program demonstrates basic integer division operations in C++. It takes two integers as input (dividend and divisor), performs division, and displays the results including quotient, remainder, and a verification equation.

## Features

- **User Input**: Interactive console input for dividend and divisor
- **Division by Zero Protection**: Checks and prevents division by zero errors
- **Complete Results Display**: Shows dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder
- **Mathematical Verification**: Displays the verification equation (dividend = divisor × quotient + remainder)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid operations

## Mathematical Concept

The program implements the fundamental division algorithm:
```
dividend = divisor × quotient + remainder
```

Where:
- **Dividend**: The number being divided
- **Divisor**: The number by which we divide
- **Quotient**: The result of the division (integer part)
- **Remainder**: The leftover after division

## Sample Output

```
Enter the first number (dividend): 17
Enter the second number (divisor): 5

--- Results ---
Dividend: 17
Divisor: 5
Quotient: 3
Remainder: 2

Verification: 17 = 5 × 3 + 2
```

## Error Handling

```
Enter the first number (dividend): 10
Enter the second number (divisor): 0
Error: Division by zero is not allowed!
```

## Technical Specifications

- **Language**: C++
- **Input Type**: Integer values
- **Output Format**: Formatted console display
- **Error Codes**: Returns 1 for division by zero, 0 for successful execution

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (g++, clang++, MSVC, etc.)
- Standard C++ library support

## Compilation

```bash
g++ quotient.cpp -o quotient
```

Or with more verbose output:
```bash
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 quotient.cpp -o quotient
```

## Usage

1. Compile the program
2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./quotient
   ```
3. Enter the dividend when prompted
4. Enter the divisor when prompted
5. View the results and verification

## Key Functions and Operations

- **Input Validation**: Checks for division by zero
- **Integer Division**: Uses C++ `/` operator for quotient
- **Modulo Operation**: Uses C++ `%` operator for remainder
- **Formatted Output**: Clean, organized result display

## Educational Value

This program is excellent for learning:
- Basic C++ input/output operations
