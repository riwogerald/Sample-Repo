## Overview

Circle drawing in computer graphics is a fundamental operation that requires efficient algorithms to plot pixels on a discrete grid. This program implements two classic approaches:

1. **Mid-point Circle Algorithm** - Also known as Bresenham's Circle Algorithm (original version)
2. **Bresenham's Circle Algorithm** - An optimized version with integer arithmetic

Both algorithms use the concept of **8-fold symmetry** to draw a complete circle by calculating only one octant and mirroring the points to the other seven octants.

## Algorithms Explained

### Mid-point Circle Algorithm

The mid-point algorithm uses a decision parameter to determine whether the next pixel should be drawn horizontally or diagonally. 

**Key Features:**
- Uses the circle equation: `xÂ² + yÂ² = rÂ²`
- Decision parameter: `d = 1 - r`
- Updates based on whether `d < 0` or `d â‰¥ 0`
- Highly efficient with only integer arithmetic

**How it works:**
1. Start at point (0, r)
2. Calculate decision parameter `d = 1 - r`
3. For each x from 0 to r:
   - If `d < 0`: move horizontally (increment x only)
   - If `d â‰¥ 0`: move diagonally (increment x, decrement y)
   - Update decision parameter accordingly
4. Plot all 8 symmetric points for each calculated point

### Bresenham's Circle Algorithm

This is an optimized version that uses a different decision parameter formulation.

**Key Features:**
- Decision parameter: `d = 3 - 2r`
- Different update formulas for better performance
- Also uses only integer arithmetic
- Slightly different pixel selection criteria

**How it works:**
1. Start at point (0, r)
2. Calculate decision parameter `d = 3 - 2r`
3. For each point while `y â‰¥ x`:
   - If `d â‰¤ 0`: move horizontally
   - If `d > 0`: move diagonally
   - Update decision parameter with different formulas
4. Plot all 8 symmetric points

### 8-fold Symmetry

Both algorithms exploit the symmetry of a circle. For any point (x, y) on the circle, these 8 points are also on the circle:
- (x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (-x, -y)
- (y, x), (-y, x), (y, -x), (-y, -x)

This means we only need to calculate 1/8 of the circle and mirror the rest.

### Key Functions Explained

#### `draw_symmetric_points(int x, int y)`
This function takes a single point (x, y) and plots all 8 symmetric points around the circle center. This is the core of the 8-fold symmetry optimization.

#### `draw_circle_midpoint()` and `draw_circle_bresenham()`
These functions implement the respective algorithms. They:
1. Initialize starting conditions
2. Loop through the first octant
3. Calculate decision parameters
4. Call `draw_symmetric_points()` for each calculated point

## Mathematical Background

### Circle Equation
The standard circle equation is: `(x - h)Â² + (y - k)Â² = rÂ²`
Where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.

### Decision Parameters

**Mid-point Algorithm:**
- Initial: `d = 1 - r`
- If `d < 0`: `d = d + 2x + 3`
- If `d â‰¥ 0`: `d = d + 2(x-y) + 5`

**Bresenham's Algorithm:**
- Initial: `d = 3 - 2r`
- If `d â‰¤ 0`: `d = d + 4x + 6`
- If `d > 0`: `d = d + 4(x-y) + 10`

### Why These Work
Both algorithms are based on the mathematical property that for a circle, we can determine the next pixel by evaluating whether the actual circle passes above or below the midpoint between potential pixel locations.

## Performance Comparison

| Aspect | Mid-point | Bresenham's |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Arithmetic** | Integer only | Integer only |
| **Accuracy** | High | High |
| **Speed** | Fast | Slightly faster |
| **Memory** | Low | Low |
| **Complexity** | Simple | Simple |

Both algorithms are extremely efficient with O(r) time complexity, where r is the radius.

## Applications

- **Computer Graphics**: Basic shape rendering
- **Game Development**: Sprite rendering, collision detection
- **Image Processing**: Shape analysis, feature detection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Compilation Errors**
   ```
   Error: GL/glut.h not found
   ```
   **Solution**: Install GLUT development libraries for your platform

2. **Linking Errors**
   ```
   undefined reference to 'glVertex2f'
   ```
   **Solution**: Make sure you're linking OpenGL libraries correctly

3. **Window Doesn't Appear**
   **Solution**: Check if your system supports OpenGL and GLUT

4. **Circle Appears Distorted**
   **Solution**: This is normal on low radius values due to pixelation

- For very large circles, you might notice performance differences
- The algorithms are optimized for typical graphics applications
- Modern GPUs handle circle drawing differently, but these algorithms remain educational
