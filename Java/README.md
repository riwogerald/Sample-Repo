# Java Files

## Factorial.java
**Purpose**: Calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
- Uses ternary operator for base case handling
- Demonstrates recursive function implementation
- Simple and clean factorial calculation

## Fibonacci.java
**Purpose**: Prints the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
- Uses iterative approach for efficiency
- Formats output with comma-separated values
- Handles edge cases for sequence generation

## Palindrome.java
**Purpose**: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
- Handles case-insensitive comparison
- Removes whitespace for better string processing
- Uses StringBuilder for string reversal
- Tests with both simple and complex palindromes

## PrimeNumber.java
**Purpose**: Checks if an integer is a prime number.
- Implements optimized primality testing algorithm
- Uses 6k±1 optimization for better performance
- Handles edge cases (numbers ≤ 1)
- Tests multiple numbers to demonstrate functionality

## SortList.java
**Purpose**: Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
- Implements both Arrays.sort() and custom bubble sort
- Demonstrates array cloning for comparison
- Shows different sorting approaches and their usage

## GCD.java
**Purpose**: Finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
- Uses Euclidean algorithm with recursion
- Efficient and mathematically sound approach
- Demonstrates classic mathematical algorithm

## LCM.java
**Purpose**: Calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers.
- Uses the relationship: LCM(a,b) = (a*b)/GCD(a,b)
- Incorporates GCD calculation as helper function
- Shows mathematical relationship between GCD and LCM
